## 💡 Signature Feature: Dynamic Project Modal

Each project is presented in a modern grid layout. Clicking any card reveals a **Framer Motion-powered Modal** with:

- 🧠 Project idea & problem it solves  
- 🔧 Technologies used  
- 📸 Image or GIF preview  
- 🔗 GitHub repo or live demo links  
- ❌ Dismiss via button or `ESC` key (fast UX)

```tsx
// Sample structure (simplified)
<ProjectCard onClick={() => setSelected(project)} />
{selected && <ProjectModal project={selected} onClose={() => setSelected(null)} />}
